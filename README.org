#+TITLE: Dotfiles Management

#+DESCRIPTION: This document lists the steps to manage dotfiles when navigating to different machines
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

** Overview
- The dotfiles are managed using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. The idea is simple:
  + For each folder, store/restore the config that's in that respective folder.
  + Reason for having separate folders is that I can restore only the things I want rather and not all of them.
  + Again, why, because 2 main reasons:
    a. My home PC contains fish shell and my office PC contains bash shell. So I make it generic rather than specialized. My fish config will all over the place in my office config, which I don't want.
    b. Say, today my office uses Linux (thanksfully, because I love Linux), but let's say I switch to another org, which uses Windows, not all the linux config would work, So I define separate config folders for Windows.

*** How does it work ?

- The bash related dotfiles, (=.bashrc=, =.bash_aliases=, etc..) are stored in a folder called 'bash'. So when setting up a new machine and assuming the 'Dotfiles' folder is cloned in $HOME directory ($HOME/Dotfiles), doing a simple: ~$ stow bash~, will restore/add the files in $HOME directory.

** Steps to restore:
- Pre-requisite: Install GNU Stow

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt install stow # This is for ubuntu. Check stow docs for how to install for other platforms
#+end_src

- Clone the repo:

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/aniketgm/Dotfiles.git
#+end_src

- Goto inside the Dotfiles and restore whatever you want:

#+begin_src bash
  cd Dotfiles
  stow bash
#+end_src

- This will restore bash files in the $HOME directory.

- Similarly, doing ~stow <folder_name_inside_Dotfiles>~, will restore the respective stuff.

- NOTE: The bashrc file contains an entry at the end for [[https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide][zoxide]] and [[https://starship.rs][starship]]. So you may want to install that first before using the config.
